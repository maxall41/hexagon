## What is Hexagon?
Hexagon is a terminal based Homelab dashboard so you can monitor all the apps you run locally and remember them üòâ.
## Features
- üî• Blazing fast
- ‚úÖ Status indicators
- üîê Secure authentication
- üéâ Terminal UI
## Why use a terminal?
Using a terminal application instead of a browser makes viewing your dashboard a more streamlined experience. Because if you are like me you prefer using your terminal over your browser.
## Usage
After you setup the server just put the server info into the client (You will be prompted) when it first starts. Once you get into the main screen of the client you should be able to see all of your apps. Press enter to goto it if you configured a URL. Emojis indicate status checking if you have it enabled.
## Configuring
The server loads a config when it starts which stores all of your apps and authentication details. It is pretty simple here is an example config it should be stored in the root directory in which you are running it as `config.json`:
```
{
  "authentication": {
    "enabled": false,
    "sha256_password_hash": "AEC8084845B41A6952D46CBAA1C9B798659487FFD133796D95D05BA45D9096C2"
  },
  "apps": [
    {
      "name": "App 1",
      "description": "This is an app (1)",
      "url": "https://example.com/",
      "checkStatus": true
    },
    {
      "name": "App 2",
      "description": "This is an app (2)",
      "url": "https://example.com/",
      "checkStatus": true
    },
    {
      "name": "App 3",
      "description": "This is an app (3)",
      "url": "https://fdsfsdfsdfs.com/3",
      "checkStatus": true,
      "_comment": "This is optional defaults to 200 as accepted code:",
      "acceptableStatusCode": [200,201]
    }
  ]
}
```
## Installing the server (NATIVE)
To run the server natively just run the below command to compile the binary then just run it!

## Installing the server (Docker-Compose)
To run the server inside Docker compose just download the repo and then run the below command inside of the server/ directory to use docker-compose file
